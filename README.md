# Technologies used:
 REACTJS, NODEJS, TAILWIND CSS, SOCKET.IO, OPENAI
 
 # Teach name: POWERPUFF BUGS(UDITI, SHREYA, SHIYA)
 
 # Problem ORHID solves:
 
 - This platform helps to stream youtube videos without any adds
 - This has an extra feature of chat bot where we can ask "SINA" (our chatbot guide) about suggesting amazing videos from youtube to watch in your boredom.
 - Orchid also has a Watch party feature where we can enter a code to join a watch party, invite our friends through the link and stream youtube videos with our friends and families.
 
 # Challenges we ran into:
 
 - We unable to integrate the chat(socket.io) feature along with the watch party feature. Although we'll work on it and make it possible.
 - We unable to make wached and watchlist feature where we can add videos into our watchlist stack and watch it later.
 - We had difficulty in managing and integrating the Youtube Api in our web app but we did it finally.
 


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
